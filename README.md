# Computer_Science

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing and reinforcing the computer science fundamentals I learned in college. It serves as a personal project to implement some common data structures and algorithms, as well as explore academic algorithms that have piqued my interest.

The project is implemented in Python, aiming to utilize Python's simplicity and readability to make the concepts as clear as possible.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the various concepts covered. Each major topic, such as a specific data structure or algorithm, is contained in its own directory.
